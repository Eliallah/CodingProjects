The first project labeled "menu.cpp" allows users to simulate ordering various goodies from the Hogwarts Express trolley. Users input the quantity of each candy item they desire, and the program calculates and displays the total cost, including the wizard tax. The code utilizes constant variables for item prices and tax rate, ensuring accuracy and flexibility as prices change. This repository provides a clear example of basic C++ input/output operations, variable usage, and mathematical calculations, all while maintaining a user-friendly interface of the wizarding world.
The 2nd project labeled "grade.cpp" allows users to calculate their final course grade based on the points they've earned in various categories, including programming assignments, midterms, Pearson points, and the final programming assignment. Users provide their scores, and the program calculates the final percentage and assigns a letter grade based on predefined criteria. It also offers the option to include extra credit points, enhancing the accuracy of the grade calculation. The code includes error checking for valid input and adheres to the provided grading formula, providing a practical tool for students to assess their course performance.
